# This minimal base is the userspace: systemd + rpm-ostree + bootloader.
# The intent of this is to inherit from this if you are doing something highly
# custom that e.g. might not involve Ignition or podman, but you do want
# rpm-ostree.
# We expect most people though using nestos-assembler to inherit from
# nestos-base.yaml.
